This project was inspired by Matteyeux with his ios-tools repo, this will be a similar project but for my own practice. Also, in native Python 3 code :D

Due to compatibility, ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed.

Also, a huge thank you to the people over at jetbrains for making PyCharm. Great IDE!
