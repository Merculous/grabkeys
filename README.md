This project was inspired by Matteyeux with his ios-tools repo, this will be a similar project but for my own practice. Also, in native Python 3 code :D

## Note
Due to compatibility, ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed. Basially this is just due some things being changed like format strings and etc.
	
## Installing
	pip install -r requirements.txt
