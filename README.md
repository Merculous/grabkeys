This project was inspired by Matteyeux with his ios-tools repo, this will be a similar project but for my own practice. Also, in native Python 3 code :D

### Prerequisites

    Python >= 3.6

## How to install
    1. python3 -m venv {your environment name here}
    2. source {environment name}
    3. pip install .
    
    After this, running "iospytools" will print the help menu,
    also by entering "iospytools -h" or "iospytools --help".

    Use the help menu to dictate which commands are necessary to use one of the features, which will all be added when I feel its ready for regular usage. Mainly for uploading to pypi.

### Features
