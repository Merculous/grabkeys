This project was inspired by Matteyeux with his ios-tools repo, this will be a similar project but for my own practice. Also, in native Python 3 code :D

### Prerequisites

    Python >= 3.9

## How to install

    1. python3 -m venv venv
    2. source venv/bin/activate
    3. pip install pipenv
    4. pipenv install

    After this, running "iospytools" will print the help menu,
    also by entering "iospytools -h" or "iospytools --help".

    Use the help menu to dictate which commands are necessary to use one of the features.

### Features
